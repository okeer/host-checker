# TCP connection checker HUB page

## Description

This project is started as a way to get familiar with Kubernetes and CI/CD related stuff. However, since there are many interesting technologies and I have very poor imagination and limited time - so I decided to reuse this idea on different stacks, different platforms and implementing different CI/CD solutions.

## List of current projects
