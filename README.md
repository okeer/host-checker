# TCP connection checker HUB page

## Description

This project is started as a way to get familiar with Kubernetes and CI/CD related stuff. However, since there are many interesting technologies and I have very poor imagination and limited time - so I decided to reuse this idea on different stacks, different platforms and implementing different CI/CD solutions.

## List of current projects

* [Dockerized Kotlin API backed on K8S, integration testings with CI/CD on Jenkins](https://github.com/okeer/tcpcheck/blob/k8s-kotlin/README.md)

* [NodeJS (TypeScript) / React full stack app on GKE with helm CD and CI/CD with CircleCI](https://github.com/okeer/tcpcheck/blob/gcp-react-nodejs/README.md)
